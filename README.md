# Intermittent NextAuth Session Validation Failure in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where NextAuth session validation on the server-side intermittently fails, leading to unauthorized access.  The issue appears to stem from race conditions in fetching and verifying session data.

## Bug Description

The code uses `unstable_getServerSession` to verify user authentication before rendering a page.  However, under load or specific timing conditions, the session check sometimes returns `null` even for authenticated users, bypassing the authorization check.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe intermittent access to protected pages even without a valid session (may require multiple refreshes or concurrent requests).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring consistent and reliable fetching of the session data, utilizing Next.js's data fetching mechanisms, and managing potential race conditions.
